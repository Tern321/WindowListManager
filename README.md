# WindowsStyleManager  
Windows style task bar for mac  
With few bugs and not production ready yet solves my problems.  
  
To open window above others windows of same app use command + click or click to app icon.  
Click on bottom right corner collapses all windows.  
  
There is problem with duplicating xcode windows, currently I havent found solution, as temporary fix I add my xcode project to xcode Projects Paths list.  
//xcodeProjectsPaths.append("file:///Users/username/Documents/git/WindowsStyleManager/") // add your project paths to fix duplicated tabs problem
